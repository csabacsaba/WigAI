# Story 1.1: Basic Bitwig Extension Project Setup

**Status:** Done

## Goal & Context

**User Story:** As a WigAI Developer, I want a basic, runnable Bitwig Java extension project configured with the necessary dependencies (Bitwig API v19, MCP Java SDK) and build system (Gradle), adhering to the defined project structure and coding standards, so that I have a foundation for implementing WigAI features.

**Context:** This is the first story in Epic 1, which focuses on establishing the core extension setup, implementing the MCP server, and enabling basic transport control. This story creates the foundational project structure and setup upon which all other components will be built. It implements the basic extension structure that will be detected by Bitwig Studio and provide logging capabilities essential for further development.

## Detailed Requirements

-   Set up a new Java project using Gradle, targeting Java 21 LTS.
-   The root package shall be `io.github.fabb.wigai`.
-   Include `com.bitwig.extension-api:19` and the latest stable MCP Java SDK as dependencies in `build.gradle.kts`.
-   Configure the Gradle build script (`build.gradle.kts`) to compile the extension and package it into a `.bwextension` file (as detailed in technical story TS6).
-   Create initial `io.github.fabb.wigai.WigAIExtension.java` (extending `ControllerExtension`) and `io.github.fabb.wigai.WigAIExtensionDefinition.java` (extending `ControllerExtensionDefinition`) classes.
-   Implement basic `Logger` (`io.github.fabb.wigai.common.Logger.java`) and `ConfigManager` (`io.github.fabb.wigai.config.ConfigManager.java`) stubs as per technical story TS1.
-   The project structure must adhere to `docs/project-structure.md`.
-   The basic extension should successfully load into Bitwig Studio (latest version, all platforms) without errors, identifiable in Bitwig's extension list with its name and version.
-   The extension should output a "WigAI Extension Loaded - Version X.Y.Z" message (including its version from `WigAIExtensionDefinition`) to the Bitwig extension console via the `Logger` on startup.

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

-   AC1: The project compiles successfully via Gradle into a `.bwextension` file.
-   AC2: The generated `.bwextension` file can be loaded into Bitwig Studio (latest version) without errors.
-   AC3: The specified confirmation message with the correct version appears in the Bitwig extension console when the extension is activated.
-   AC4: The project structure and initial classes adhere to `docs/project-structure.md` and use the package `io.github.fabb.wigai`.
-   AC5: `Logger` and `ConfigManager` stubs are present and integrated into `WigAIExtension`.

## Technical Implementation Context

**Guidance:** Use the following details for implementation. Developer agent is expected to follow project standards in `docs/coding-standards.md` and understand the project structure in `docs/project-structure.md`. Only story-specific details are included below.

-   **Relevant Files:**

    -   Files to Create:
        -   `build.gradle.kts` (main Gradle build script)
        -   `settings.gradle.kts` (Gradle settings file)
        -   `gradle/wrapper/gradle-wrapper.properties` (Gradle wrapper configuration)
        -   `gradle/wrapper/gradle-wrapper.jar` (Gradle wrapper JAR)
        -   `.gitignore` (Git ignore file for Java/Gradle projects)
        -   `src/main/java/io/github/fabb/wigai/WigAIExtension.java` (Main extension class extending `ControllerExtension`)
        -   `src/main/java/io/github/fabb/wigai/WigAIExtensionDefinition.java` (Extension definition class extending `ControllerExtensionDefinition`)
        -   `src/main/java/io/github/fabb/wigai/common/Logger.java` (Basic logging utility)
        -   `src/main/java/io/github/fabb/wigai/common/AppConstants.java` (Application constants)
        -   `src/main/java/io/github/fabb/wigai/config/ConfigManager.java` (Configuration management stub)

-   **Key Technologies:**

    -   Java 21 LTS
    -   Gradle build system (latest stable, e.g., 8.x)
    -   Bitwig Extension API v19
    -   MCP Java SDK (latest stable version)

-   **API Interactions / SDK Usage:**

    -   Bitwig Extension API v19:
        -   `com.bitwig.extension.controller.ControllerExtension`: Base class for the extension
        -   `com.bitwig.extension.controller.ControllerExtensionDefinition`: Base class for extension definition
        -   `com.bitwig.extension.controller.api.ControllerHost`: Main interface to interact with Bitwig

-   **Data Structures:**

    -   `AppConstants`: Class with static final constants including:
        -   `DEFAULT_MCP_PORT` (int): Default port for MCP server (61169)
        -   `APP_NAME` (String): "WigAI"
        -   `APP_VERSION` (String): "0.1.0"
        -   `APP_AUTHOR` (String): "fabb"

-   **Environment Variables:**

    -   No specific environment variables are needed for this story.

-   **Coding Standards Notes:**

    -   Follow conventions specified in `docs/coding-standards.md`, particularly:
        -   Google Java Style Guide for formatting
        -   Proper package naming: `io.github.fabb.wigai`
        -   Class naming: `PascalCase` (e.g., `WigAIExtension`)
        -   Constants: `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE` (e.g., `DEFAULT_MCP_PORT`)

## Testing Requirements

**Guidance:** Verify implementation against the ACs using the following tests. Follow general testing approach in `docs/testing-strategy.md`.

-   **Unit Tests:** Not required for this initial setup story.

-   **Manual/CLI Verification:**
    1. Run `./gradlew build` to ensure the project compiles successfully
    2. Verify the `.bwextension` file is generated in the `build` directory
    3. Install the extension in Bitwig Studio and verify it appears in the extensions list
    4. Enable the extension and check the Bitwig console for the startup message with correct version
