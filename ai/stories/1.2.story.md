# Story 1.2: MCP Server Listener Implementation

**Status:** Ready

## Goal & Context

**User Story:** As the WigAI System, I want to initialize an MCP server listener (using the MCP Java SDK with Streamable HTTP/SSE transport) on a configurable local network port when the Bitwig extension starts, so that external AI agents can connect and send MCP commands.

**Context:** This story builds upon the basic project setup from Story 1.1, which established the foundational Bitwig extension. Now we need to implement the core MCP server component that will enable communication between external AI agents and the WigAI extension. This is a critical feature as it establishes the communication channel for all future functionality in the extension.

## Detailed Requirements

* Implement an `McpServerManager` class within the `io.github.fabb.wigai.mcp` package.
* This manager will use the MCP Java SDK to configure and start an embedded HTTP server supporting the MCP Streamable HTTP transport (which utilizes SSE for streaming).
* The listening IP address should default to `localhost`.
* The port number should be retrieved from the `ConfigManager` (defaulting to `61169` as per `AppConstants`).
* The server (managed by `McpServerManager`) should start when the `WigAIExtension`'s `init()` method is called and the extension is enabled.
* The server should shut down gracefully when the `WigAIExtension`'s `exit()` method is called (extension is disabled or Bitwig closes).
* Log server status (e.g., "MCP Server started on http://localhost:61169/mcp", "MCP Server stopped") to the Bitwig extension console via the `Logger` service.
* The server should be able to accept incoming HTTP connections on its defined MCP endpoint (e.g., `/mcp`).

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

* AC1: The `McpServerManager` successfully starts the embedded MCP server on the configured port (e.g., 61169) when the extension loads.
* AC2: A log message from the `Logger` service confirms the MCP server has started, including the listening address and port.
* AC3: The MCP server stops gracefully when the extension is disabled or Bitwig exits, confirmed by a log message.
* AC4: An external tool (e.g., `curl` or a simple HTTP client) can make a basic HTTP GET or POST request to the MCP endpoint (e.g., `http://localhost:61169/mcp`) and receive an HTTP response (even if it's an MCP error for an unknown command at this stage, the HTTP connection itself should work).

## Technical Implementation Context

**Guidance:** Use the following details for implementation. Developer agent is expected to follow project standards in `docs/coding-standards.md` and understand the project structure in `docs/project-structure.md`. Only story-specific details are included below.

- **Relevant Files:**

  - Files to Create:
    - `src/main/java/io/github/fabb/wigai/mcp/McpServerManager.java` (Main server manager class)

  - Files to Modify:
    - `src/main/java/io/github/fabb/wigai/WigAIExtension.java` (To integrate the McpServerManager)

- **Key Technologies:**

  - MCP Java SDK (latest stable version)
  - HTTP Server with SSE capability via MCP Java SDK's Streamable HTTP transport
  - Java 21 LTS features

- **API Interactions / SDK Usage:**

  - **MCP Java SDK:**
    - Use relevant classes from the MCP Java SDK to create and configure the server
    - Configure transport type as Streamable HTTP with SSE support
    - Set up server endpoint (e.g., `/mcp`)
  
  - **Bitwig Extension API:**
    - `init()` method in `WigAIExtension` to start the MCP server
    - `exit()` method in `WigAIExtension` to stop the MCP server

- **Data Structures:**

  - `ConfigManager` for retrieving port configuration
  - `AppConstants.DEFAULT_MCP_PORT` (61169) as the default port value

- **Environment Variables:**

  - No specific environment variables are needed for this story

- **Coding Standards Notes:**

  - Follow conventions specified in `docs/coding-standards.md`
  - Proper error handling for server start/stop operations
  - Appropriate logging using the `Logger` service
  - Clean lifecycle management (start/stop)

## Testing Requirements

**Guidance:** Verify implementation against the ACs using the following tests. Follow general testing approach in `docs/testing-strategy.md`.

- **Unit Tests:** Basic tests for McpServerManager class structure and configuration methods (if any).

- **Manual/CLI Verification:**
  1. Build and load the extension into Bitwig Studio
  2. Check the Bitwig extension console for the server start log message
  3. Use a tool like `curl` to make a request to the MCP endpoint (e.g., `curl -X POST http://localhost:61169/mcp -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"command":"unknown"}'`)
  4. Verify that the server responds (even with an error for unknown command)
  5. Disable the extension and check for the server stop log message
  6. Try to connect again to verify the server is no longer available
