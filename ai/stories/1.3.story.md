# Story 1.3: Implement Standard MCP Ping and Custom Status Tool

**Status:** In Progress

## Goal & Context

**User Story:** As an External AI Agent Developer, I want to verify connectivity with WigAI through standard MCP mechanisms and retrieve version information via a custom tool, so that I can verify both basic connectivity and that WigAI is operational with version details.

**Context:** This story builds upon Stories 1.1 and 1.2, which established the foundational Bitwig extension and basic MCP server implementation. Now we need to implement two key MCP components:
1. Support for the standard MCP Ping functionality as defined in the official specification to verify basic connectivity
2. A custom "status" tool that provides detailed WigAI version information

For this implementation, we should leverage the official MCP Java SDK's built-in components as much as possible for handling JSON-RPC 2.0 message processing, tool registration, and request handling. Additionally, we'll ensure compatibility with the standard MCP `tools/list` endpoint that comes built-in with the MCP Java SDK.

## Detailed Requirements

### Standard MCP Ping Endpoint

* The WigAI MCP server should implement the standard MCP ping functionality as defined in the official MCP specification.
* The standard ping request follows this format:
  ```json
  {
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "id": 1,
    "method": "ping"
  }
  ```
* Upon receiving a standard ping request:
    * The server must respond with an empty result object as specified:
      ```json
      {
        "jsonrpc": "2.0",
        "id": 1,
        "result": {}
      }
      ```
* The MCP server should log the receipt of ping requests and responses.

### Custom Status Tool

* The WigAI MCP server should also implement a custom "status" tool using the MCP Java SDK's built-in components for handling JSON-RPC 2.0 messages, tool registration, and request routing.
* The status tool request should follow the official MCP specification format:
  ```json
  {
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "id": 1,
    "method": "tools/call",
    "params": {
      "name": "status",
      "arguments": {}
    }
  }
  ```
* Upon receiving a valid "status" tool call:
    * WigAI should not need to interact with the Bitwig API for this tool.
    * It should construct a success response as specified in the updated `docs/mcp-api-spec.md`:
      ```json
      {
        "jsonrpc": "2.0",
        "id": 1,
        "result": {
          "content": [
            {
              "type": "text",
              "text": "WigAI v0.2.0 is operational" // Version fetched from WigAIExtensionDefinition
            }
          ],
          "isError": false
        }
      }
      ```
* The version reported in the response should be dynamically retrieved from the `WigAIExtensionDefinition` (or a constant reflecting it).
* The MCP server should log the receipt of the "status" tool call and the response sent.

### General Requirements

* Ensure the MCP server properly supports the built-in standard MCP endpoints:
  * `tools/list` - This endpoint should return the list of available tools the server supports.
  * For this initial implementation, register the "status" tool and verify that `tools/list` includes it in its response.

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

### Standard MCP Ping
* AC1: Sending a valid MCP standard ping request (using the JSON-RPC 2.0 format with `"method": "ping"`) to the WigAI server's MCP endpoint results in a successful MCP response with `Content-Type: application/json` and an empty result object.
* AC2: The `Logger` service logs the receipt of standard ping requests and responses.

### Custom Status Tool
* AC3: Sending a valid "status" tool call (using the JSON-RPC 2.0 format with `tools/call` method) to the WigAI server's MCP endpoint results in a successful MCP response with `Content-Type: application/json` and the body matching the specified JSON structure (including the current WigAI version).
* AC4: The `Logger` service logs the receipt of the "status" tool call and the content of the response.
* AC5: The version in the response accurately reflects the version set in `WigAIExtensionDefinition`.

### Error Handling
* AC6: Invalid or malformed requests (e.g., incorrect JSON, unknown method or tool name) result in an appropriate JSON-RPC 2.0 error response (e.g., method not found, invalid params) and are logged by the `Logger` service.

### Tools Listing
* AC7: The standard MCP `tools/list` request returns a valid JSON-RPC 2.0 response listing the "status" tool with its proper schema definition.

## Technical Implementation Context

**Guidance:** Use the following details for implementation. Developer agent is expected to follow project standards in `docs/coding-standards.md` and understand the project structure in `docs/project-structure.md`. Only story-specific details are included below.

- **Relevant Files:**

  - Files to Create:
    - `src/main/java/io/github/fabb/wigai/mcp/tool/StatusTool.java`: Implementation of the "status" tool using the MCP Java SDK's tool interfaces

  - Files to Modify:
    - `src/main/java/io/github/fabb/wigai/mcp/McpServerManager.java`: Update to configure and utilize the MCP Java SDK's built-in tool support, standard ping handling, server components, and request handling

- **Key Technologies:**

  - Java 21 (language features including records, interfaces, etc.)
  - MCP Java SDK (using the official tools-based implementation)
    - SDK's JSON-RPC 2.0 processing
    - SDK's HTTP/Server-Sent Events handling
    - SDK's tool registry and request routing components

- **API Interactions / SDK Usage:**

  - Leverage the official MCP Java SDK for:
    - Server implementation with Streamable HTTP/SSE transport

    - Tool registration, validation, and management
    - Standard endpoint handling (`tools/list` and `tools/call`)
    - Request/response flow
    - Error handling
  
  - Focus on using the SDK's built-in components rather than implementing custom ones:
    - Use the SDK's server and transport implementation directly
    - Use the SDK's tool registry system instead of building a custom `RequestRouter`
    - Use the SDK's JSON-RPC message parsing instead of a custom `McpCommandParser`
    - Limit custom code to integration between the SDK and Bitwig-specific functionality
  - The implementation must adhere to the official MCP specification and updated `docs/mcp-api-spec.md`
  - For version information, access `AppConstants.APP_VERSION` or the WigAI extension definition
  - Implement tool classes by extending/implementing the SDK's tool interfaces

- **Data Structures:**

  - JSON-RPC 2.0 request/response structures handled by MCP Java SDK
  - Tool-specific input/output schemas defined per tool
  
  - For the standard MCP ping:

        }
      }
      ```

- **Coding Standards Notes:**

  - Implement tool interfaces according to MCP specification
  - Use Java records for tool input/output models where appropriate
  - Follow error handling strategy in `docs/coding-standards.md`
  - Adhere to JSON-RPC 2.0 error codes for appropriate error cases
  - Log appropriate messages for incoming tool calls and responses

## Testing Requirements

**Guidance:** Verify implementation against the ACs using the following tests. Follow general testing approach in `docs/testing-strategy.md`.

- **Unit Tests:** 
  - Test the MCP Java SDK integration and server configuration
  - Test proper tool registration and retrieval using the SDK's registry
  - Test the standard MCP ping request handling
  - Test `StatusTool` implementation specifically
  - Test tool error handling and JSON-RPC error code responses using the SDK's facilities

- **Manual/CLI Verification:** 
  - Use a tool like `curl` to send HTTP POST requests with JSON-RPC 2.0 formatted data:
    - Test the standard MCP ping: `curl -X POST http://localhost:61169/mcp -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"ping"}'`
    - Test the `tools/list` endpoint: `curl -X POST http://localhost:61169/mcp -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"tools/list"}'`
    - Test the `tools/call` endpoint with the status tool: `curl -X POST http://localhost:61169/mcp -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"tools/call","params":{"name":"status","arguments":{}}}'`
  - Verify the responses match the expected JSON-RPC 2.0 format
  - Test error cases (invalid method, malformed JSON, etc.) and verify correct error codes
  - Check that log messages appear in the Bitwig extension console
