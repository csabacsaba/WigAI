# WigAI Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Intro

WigAI is a software component designed to enhance the creative workflow for Bitwig Studio musicians. It functions as a **Model Context Protocol (MCP) server** implemented as a **Bitwig Java Extension**. This allows external AI agents (e.g., IDE-based copilots, standalone AI assistants) to interact with and control Bitwig Studio via text-based commands translated into MCP messages. The Minimum Viable Product (MVP) focuses on enabling core functionalities: AI-driven playback control, clip/scene triggering, and manipulation of device parameters, all initiated by an external AI agent interpreting user's text commands. This project aims to provide a new, intelligent, and hands-free way to interact with Bitwig, fostering creativity and aiding live performance.

## Goals and Context

-   **Project Objectives:**
    1.  To develop a Bitwig Java extension that acts as an MCP server, exposing control over specific Bitwig functionalities.
    2.  Enable external AI agents to control Bitwig's transport (start/stop playback) via MCP commands.
    3.  Enable external AI agents to trigger user-specified clips (by track name and clip index/scene number) and entire scenes in Bitwig via MCP commands.
    4.  Enable external AI agents to read and set the eight (8) parameters of the currently selected device in Bitwig via MCP commands.
    5.  To achieve this using exclusively open-source tools and the official Bitwig Java Extension API (version 19).
-   **Measurable Outcomes:**
    1.  Successful and reliable starting and stopping of Bitwig playback initiated by an MCP command.
    2.  Successful and reliable triggering of specified clips and scenes in Bitwig initiated by an MCP command.
    3.  Successful and reliable reading and setting of the 8 parameters for the currently selected Bitwig device initiated by MCP commands.
-   **Success Criteria:**
    * The WigAI Bitwig extension installs and runs stably on all Bitwig-supported platforms (macOS, Windows, Linux).
    * All three MVP functionalities (transport, clip/scene launch, device parameter control) are demonstrably working as per the defined MCP interactions.
    * The system can handle valid MCP requests for the implemented features without crashing Bitwig or the extension.
    * Basic error states (e.g., clip not found, invalid parameter index) are communicated back via MCP if the protocol supports it, or logged appropriately.
-   **Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):**
    * Number of successful MCP commands processed for each core feature (transport, clip/scene launch, parameter control).
    * (Post-MVP/User Adoption) Number of unique Bitwig parameters successfully controlled via WigAI (as an indicator of utility and potential expansion).

## Scope and Requirements (MVP / Current Version)

### Functional Requirements (High-Level)

1.  **MCP Server Implementation (Bitwig Extension):**
    * Implement a server within the Bitwig Java Extension that listens for and processes incoming MCP messages on a configurable local network port.
    * Adhere to basic MCP principles for request/response handling for the scope of implemented features.
2.  **Transport Control:**
    * Accept MCP commands to start Bitwig's playback.
    * Accept MCP commands to stop Bitwig's playback.
3.  **Clip and Scene Launching:**
    * Accept MCP commands to launch a specific clip, identified by track name and clip index (slot/scene number).
    * Accept MCP commands to launch an entire scene, identified by its name or index.
    * Provide feedback on the success or failure of the launch command (e.g., clip/scene not found).
4.  **Device Parameter Control (Selected Device):**
    * Accept MCP commands to read the current values of the eight (8) addressable parameters of the device currently selected by the user in Bitwig's UI.
    * Return the parameter names (if available via API) and their current values in an MCP response.
    * Accept MCP commands to set specific values for one or more of the eight (8) addressable parameters of the currently selected device.
    * The external AI agent is responsible for translating user's natural language (e.g., "make parameter 1 higher", "randomize parameters slightly") into specific parameter indices and values for the MCP command. WigAI MVP will not perform natural language interpretation for parameter changes.

### Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs)

-   **Performance:**
    * MCP command processing should be near real-time to ensure a responsive user experience when interacting via the AI agent. (e.g., <100ms processing time within the extension for most commands, excluding Bitwig's own processing time).
-   **Scalability:**
    * The extension should handle sequential MCP commands robustly. (Concurrent command handling is not an MVP focus but the server should not break if multiple connections are attempted; it can process one at a time).
-   **Reliability/Availability:**
    * The Bitwig extension must be stable and not cause Bitwig Studio to crash.
    * Basic error handling for invalid MCP messages or failed Bitwig API calls should be implemented, with errors logged within Bitwig's extension console.
-   **Security:**
    * The MCP server will listen on a local network port. No specific authentication mechanisms for incoming MCP connections are required for MVP, as it's intended for local control. Users should be aware of this if exposing the port more widely.
-   **Maintainability:**
    * Java code should be well-organized, commented, and follow standard Java conventions to facilitate understanding and future development (especially important for an open-source hobby project).
-   **Usability/Accessibility:**
    * Not directly applicable to WigAI itself, as it is a server component without a direct UI. The usability and accessibility pertain to the external AI agent and its interface.
-   **Compatibility:**
    * Must function on all operating systems supported by Bitwig Studio (macOS, Windows, Linux).
    * Must use and be compatible with the official Bitwig Java Extension API version 19.
-   **Resource Usage:**
    * The extension should be mindful of CPU and memory usage and not unduly burden the Bitwig Studio process.
-   **Open Source:**
    * All tools, libraries, and code developed will use the MIT license.

### MVP Success and Evolution

-   **User Feedback:** While direct user feedback mechanisms are not part of the WigAI component itself (as it's a server), feedback will be gathered indirectly through community interaction (e.g., forums, GitHub issues) if the project is shared. This feedback will be crucial for prioritizing future enhancements.
-   **Criteria for Moving Beyond MVP:**
    *   Successful demonstration of all MVP features with stability.
    *   Positive feedback from initial testers or users (if applicable) indicating the core concept is useful and usable.
    *   Identification of clear, high-value next steps based on initial experiences and potential user requests.
-   **Learning Goals (MVP):**
    *   Validate the feasibility of controlling Bitwig Studio via an external AI agent using the MCP approach.
    *   Understand the core challenges and limitations of the Bitwig Java Extension API for this type of interaction.
    *   Gain insights into the types of Bitwig controls that are most valuable and intuitive to expose via such an interface.
    *   Establish a foundational codebase for potential future expansion.

## User Interaction and Design Goals

While WigAI itself is a server component without a direct user interface, it is a critical intermediary in the user's interaction with Bitwig Studio via an external AI agent. The design goals for WigAI's role in this interaction are:

*   **Seamless Mediation:** WigAI should facilitate a smooth and seemingly direct interaction between the user (via their chosen AI agent) and Bitwig Studio. The user should feel as though they are naturally conversing with an assistant that has direct control over the DAW.
*   **Empowering Creativity and Control:** The ultimate goal is to empower musicians by providing an intuitive, flexible, and powerful way to control Bitwig Studio. Interactions should feel creative and fluid, not cumbersome or overly technical.
*   **Clarity and Predictability via MCP:**
    *   WigAI's MCP implementation must be clear, well-documented, and predictable. This enables AI agent developers to build reliable integrations.
    *   Responses to MCP commands (success, failure, data retrieval) should be informative and allow the AI agent to provide useful feedback to the user.
*   **Facilitating Richer Agent Interactions (MCP-Driven Context):**
    *   WigAI can enhance the capabilities of connected AI agents by providing Bitwig-specific context or "prompts" via MCP. For example, when a user asks to interact with a device, WigAI could inform the agent about the currently selected device's type and its parameters. This allows the AI agent to have more informed interactions and better translate user intent into specific Bitwig actions (e.g., "User is asking to change a filter. Available parameters on the selected device are Cutoff, Resonance, Drive. Common user intent involves adjusting cutoff and resonance.").
*   **Robustness and Reliability:** The interaction must be reliable. Errors within WigAI or in its communication with Bitwig should be handled gracefully and reported clearly via MCP to the agent, allowing the agent to inform the user appropriately.
*   **Focus on the External Agent's UX:** Since the user directly interacts with the external AI agent, WigAI's design should indirectly support a good UX for that agent. This means providing the necessary MCP capabilities for the agent to:
    *   Understand the state of relevant Bitwig elements (e.g., selected device parameters).
    *   Execute commands effectively.
    *   Receive meaningful feedback.

The primary interaction model is:
1.  User issues a text-based (or potentially voice) command to an external AI agent.
2.  The external AI agent interprets this command and translates it into one or more MCP messages.
3.  The AI agent sends these MCP messages to the WigAI server.
4.  WigAI processes the MCP messages, interacts with Bitwig Studio via the Java Extension API, and formulates an MCP response.
5.  WigAI sends the MCP response back to the AI agent.
6.  The AI agent interprets the response and communicates the outcome or requested information to the user.

### Example User Stories

*   **As a solo live performer,** I want to use voice commands via my AI assistant to trigger specific scenes in Bitwig, so I can keep my hands on my instrument and focus on the performance.
*   **As a music producer exploring sound design,** I want to ask my AI copilot to "slightly increase the filter cutoff on the current synth" and have it adjust the correct parameter in Bitwig, so I can experiment with sounds more fluidly without menu diving.
*   **As a songwriter quickly capturing ideas,** I want to tell my AI agent to "start recording in Bitwig" or "stop playback," so I can manage the recording process efficiently while focusing on my musical performance.
*   **As a Bitwig user with a complex setup,** I want my AI assistant to be able to query and tell me the current settings of the selected device's main parameters, so I can quickly understand its state without needing to look at the screen.
*   **As a developer of an AI music assistant,** I want a clear and reliable MCP interface (WigAI) to Bitwig, so I can easily integrate Bitwig control into my assistant and offer powerful DAW interaction features to my users.

## Technical Assumptions

This section outlines the foundational technical decisions and context for WigAI.

-   **Core Technology:** WigAI is implemented as a Bitwig Java Extension. The primary programming language is Java, adhering to the requirements of the Bitwig Extension API (version 19).
-   **Communication Protocol:** The extension functions as a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server, listening for and processing incoming MCP messages on a configurable local network port. The exact MCP message structures for WigAI's features will be defined in `docs/mcp-api-spec.md`.
-   **Operating System Compatibility:** The extension must be compatible with macOS, Windows, and Linux—all platforms where Bitwig Studio runs. The Java code should be platform-agnostic.
-   **Resource Management:** The extension must be efficient in its use of CPU and memory to avoid performance degradation or instability in Bitwig Studio.
-   **Budget & Licensing:** Development will use exclusively open-source tools and libraries, free of charge. The project itself will be open-source (e.g., MIT or Apache 2.0 license).
-   **Repository & Service Architecture:** WigAI is developed as a single Bitwig Java Extension, effectively a monolithic component within the Bitwig Studio environment. The repository will be a monorepo located in the `WigAI` folder, containing all source code, build scripts (Gradle), and documentation for this extension.

### Testing Requirements

Validating WigAI's functionality will involve several layers:

-   **Unit Tests:** JUnit will be used for testing individual Java classes and methods, particularly those handling MCP message parsing, command processing logic, and interactions with the Bitwig API.
-   **Integration Testing (MCP Client Simulation):** Manual and potentially automated end-to-end testing will be performed using a simple MCP client (e.g., a Python script, Node.js script, or a command-line tool like `curl` if MCP is implemented over HTTP). This client will simulate an external AI agent sending MCP commands to WigAI running within Bitwig Studio to verify all supported functionalities.
-   **Bitwig Studio Integration:** Bitwig Studio itself is essential for integration testing, ensuring the extension loads correctly, interacts with the Bitwig environment as expected, and does not cause instability.
-   **Cross-Platform Testing:** Testing across all Bitwig-supported operating systems (macOS, Windows, Linux) is desired to ensure compatibility, if feasible for the hobbyist developer.
-   **Logging for Diagnostics:** The extension will use Bitwig's provided extension logging mechanisms (`host.println()`) for diagnostics and troubleshooting during development and testing.
-   **Local Development Environment:** Development will utilize a standard Java IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition, VSCode) with Gradle for build management, as is common for Bitwig extension development.

### Integration Requirements (High-Level)

1.  **External AI Agent Integration:**
    * WigAI will expose an MCP server endpoint (configurable local IP and port) for external AI agents to connect and send MCP messages.
    * The specific MCP message schema (JSON structure, command names, parameters) for each supported function (transport, clip/scene launch, device parameters) needs to be defined and documented for AI agent developers.
2.  **Bitwig Studio Integration:**
    * WigAI will use the official Bitwig Java Extension API (version 19) to interact with Bitwig Studio for all its functionalities.

### Testing Requirements (High-Level)

-   Unit tests for individual Java classes and methods, particularly those handling MCP message parsing and Bitwig API interactions.
-   Manual end-to-end testing using a simple script-based or command-line MCP client to simulate an external AI agent and verify all supported functionalities within Bitwig.
-   Testing across all supported operating systems (macOS, Windows, Linux) is desired, if feasible for the hobbyist developer.

## Epic Overview (MVP / Current Version)

-   **Epic 1: Core Extension Setup, MCP Server Initialization, and Basic Transport Control**
    * **Goal:** Establish the foundational Bitwig Java extension, implement the basic MCP server listener, and enable start/stop transport control via MCP commands. This proves the core communication pathway.
-   **Epic 2: Device Parameter Read and Write Implementation**
    * **Goal:** Enable reading and writing of the eight parameters for the currently selected Bitwig device via MCP commands, allowing the AI agent to both query device state and modify it.
-   **Epic 3: Clip and Scene Launching Implementation**
    * **Goal:** Enable the triggering of individual clips (by track name and clip index/scene) and entire scenes (by name or index) via MCP commands, expanding interactive control.

## Key Reference Documents

-   `docs/project-brief.md`
-   `docs/architecture.md` (To be created by Architect)
-   `docs/epic1.md`, `docs/epic2.md`, `docs/epic3.md` (To be created)

-   More sophisticated MCP query capabilities (e.g., listing available tracks, scenes, devices, parameters).
-   Direct handling of "creative" commands within WigAI with more built-in logic (e.g., "randomize parameters with X characteristic"), reducing reliance on external AI agent's interpretation for common creative gestures.
-   Support for asynchronous operations and notifications from WigAI to the MCP client (e.g., when a new track is added manually in Bitwig).
-   Built-in mapping capabilities for users to customize how AI commands map to Bitwig actions beyond the selected device.
-   Exploration of simpler setup/discovery mechanisms for the MCP connection.

## Key Dependencies, Risks, and Mitigations

### Key Dependencies

*   **Bitwig Studio:** Requires Bitwig Studio (version supporting Extension API 19 or later) to be running.
*   **Java Development Kit (JDK):** A compatible JDK is needed for development and for Bitwig to run Java extensions.
*   **External AI Agent:** The functionality of WigAI is entirely dependent on an external AI agent capable of sending MCP commands and interpreting responses.
*   **Operating System:** Relies on the underlying OS (macOS, Windows, Linux) for Bitwig Studio and Java runtime stability.

### Risks and Mitigations

*   **Risk: Bitwig API Limitations or Changes:** The Bitwig API might not support all desired interactions, or future changes could break compatibility.
    *   **Mitigation:** Thoroughly test with the target API version (19). Design for graceful degradation if certain API calls fail. Monitor Bitwig API updates.
*   **Risk: Extension Stability:** Bugs in the extension could cause instability in Bitwig Studio.
    *   **Mitigation:** Adhere to Bitwig extension development best practices. Implement robust error handling and logging. Conduct thorough testing (Unit, Integration).
*   **Risk: Limited Adoption by AI Agents:** External AI agent developers might not integrate with WigAI if the MCP API is unclear, unstable, or not compelling.
    *   **Mitigation:** Provide clear and comprehensive documentation for the MCP API (`docs/mcp-api-spec.md`). Ensure the MVP features are genuinely useful and reliable.
*   **Risk: Development Resource Constraints:** As a hobby project, time for extensive testing (especially cross-platform) and feature development is limited.
    *   **Mitigation:** Focus on a lean MVP. Prioritize core functionality and stability. Leverage community feedback if the project is shared.

## Open Issues and Questions

*   **MCP API Specification:** The detailed MCP message structures and API specifications need to be documented in `docs/mcp-api-spec.md`.
*   **Cross-Platform Testing Scope:** The extent of formal testing on all supported platforms (macOS, Windows, Linux) is dependent on hobbyist developer resources and setup.

*(The PRD & EPIC VALIDATION SUMMARY table from the checklist is omitted here as this report serves a similar purpose item by item)*

## Initial Architect Prompt

**Objective:** Define the technical architecture for the WigAI Bitwig Java Extension.
**Mode:** Architecture Creation Mode
**Primary Input:** This completed PRD document.

**Key Guidance & Pointers:**

*   **Core Requirements & Scope:** Refer to "Goals and Context," "Scope and Requirements (MVP / Current Version)," and "Epic Overview (MVP / Current Version)" for the what and why.
*   **Technical Foundations:** All foundational technical decisions, constraints, and testing requirements are detailed in the "## Technical Assumptions" section of this PRD. This includes:
    *   Core Technology (Java, Bitwig API v19)
    *   Communication Protocol (MCP)
    *   OS Compatibility
    *   Resource Management expectations
    *   Budget & Licensing (Open Source)
    *   Repository & Service Architecture (Monorepo, Monolithic Component)
    *   Detailed Testing Requirements & Local Development Environment setup (Gradle, Java IDE).
*   **MCP Server Details:** The "Backend Platform" is the WigAI Java extension itself, hosting an MCP server (e.g., using a lightweight HTTP server library or raw socket listener). Specifics of the MCP message structures will be in `docs/mcp-api-spec.md` (to be created).
*   **Deployment:** The output is a `.bwextension` file. A Gradle build script is expected. CI/CD is not an MVP requirement. The extension runs within the Bitwig Studio JVM environment.
*   **Key NFRs:** Pay close attention to Non-Functional Requirements such as Performance, Reliability, and Maintainability detailed in the "Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs)" section.
*   **API Evolution & Error Handling:** Consider Bitwig API evolution. Implement robust error handling; the extension should not crash Bitwig. Errors in MCP processing should be logged and communicated via MCP if possible. Design for simplicity in MVP.
*   **Starter Project/Template:** None explicitly required, but standard Java project structure for a Bitwig Extension should be followed. Examples like "DrivenByMoss" can serve as a reference for structure and API usage.

Please use this PRD to create the `docs/architecture.md` document, detailing the system design, component interactions, data flows (for MCP messages), and any further necessary technical specifications for the WigAI extension.
