# Story 1.5: Implement MCP Transport Stop Command

## Status: Complete

## Story

- As a Musician (via an External AI Agent)
- I want to command WigAI to stop Bitwig's playback via an MCP message
- so that I can control transport hands-free

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

1. Sending the "transport_stop" MCP command to WigAI's MCP endpoint causes Bitwig's main transport playback to stop.
2. WigAI returns a successful MCP response matching the specified JSON structure.
3. If playback is already stopped, the command is gracefully handled (Bitwig API typically handles this; WigAI should still return success).
4. The Logger service logs the command, the invocation of the Bitwig stop action, and the response.

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [x] Register the "transport_stop" command in the MCP server (AC: 1)
- [x] Implement handler in TransportController to call BitwigApiFacade for stop (AC: 1, 3)
- [x] Ensure MCP response matches required JSON structure (AC: 2)
- [x] Log command receipt, action, and response (AC: 4)
- [x] Add to MCP tools/list response (if applicable)

## Dev Technical Guidance
- Use the pattern established in Story 1.4 for command registration and response structure.
- Reference docs/mcp-api-spec.md for exact MCP response format.
- Ensure the handler is idempotent (safe to call if already stopped).
- Log all relevant actions using the Logger service.
- Update docs/component-view.md and docs/api-reference.md if new interfaces are introduced.

## Story Progress Notes

### Agent Model Used: `<Agent Model Name/Version>`

### Completion Notes List
- All acceptance criteria for Story 1.5 are now met:
  - The "transport_stop" command is registered in the MCP server and appears in the tools list.
  - The handler in TransportController calls BitwigApiFacade.stopTransport(), which is idempotent and logs all actions.
  - MCP responses match the required JSON structure as per the API reference.
  - Logger service logs command receipt, action, and response.
  - Documentation in docs/api-reference.md and docs/component-view.md has been updated to reflect the new interface.
- Implementation and tests follow the pattern established in Story 1.4.
- Build and all tests pass as of 2025-05-22.
