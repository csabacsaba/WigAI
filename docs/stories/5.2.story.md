# Story 5.2: Selected Track and Project Parameters Status

**Status:** InProgress

**Epic:** [Epic 5: Enhance MCP `status` Command](../epic-5.md)

**User Stories:**

*   As an AI agent, I want to access global project parameters, so I can read or potentially suggest modifications to them.
*   As an AI agent, I want to get information about the currently selected track (index, name, type, mute/solo/arm status), so I can perform track-specific operations.

**Depends on:** [Story 5.1](./5.1.story.md)

**Acceptance Criteria:**

*   The `status` MCP command response, in addition to fields from 5.1, includes:
    *   `project_parameters` (array of objects), where each object contains:
        *   `index` (integer, 0-7)
        *   `exists` (boolean)
        *   `name` (string, null if not exists)
        *   `value` (float, normalized 0.0-1.0, null if not exists)
        *   `display_value` (string, null if not exists)
        *   Only parameters where `exists` is true are included in the array.
    *   A `selected_track` object (or null if no track is selected/applicable) containing:
        *   `index` (integer, 0-based)
        *   `name` (string)
        *   `type` (string, e.g., "audio", "instrument")
        *   `is_group` (boolean)
        *   `muted` (boolean)
        *   `soloed` (boolean)
        *   `armed` (boolean)
*   The `StatusTool.java` correctly queries the Bitwig API for project parameters (e.g., via a `RemoteControlsPage` for the project) and selected track details (e.g., via `CursorTrack`).
*   The `api-reference.md` is updated to reflect these new fields.
*   The tool gracefully handles cases where no track is selected (selected_track should be null) or no project parameters are configured (project_parameters should be an empty array).

**Tasks:**

1.  ‚úÖ Modify `StatusTool.java` to fetch project parameters. This will likely involve accessing the project's `RemoteControlsPage`.
2.  ‚úÖ Modify `StatusTool.java` to fetch selected track details (`index`, `name`, `type`, `is_group`, `muted`, `soloed`, `armed`) using `CursorTrack` or similar.
3.  ‚úÖ Update the JSON construction in `StatusTool.java` to include `project_parameters` array and `selected_track` object.
4.  ‚úÖ Update `docs/api-reference.md` with the new response fields for this story.
5.  ‚úÖ Write unit tests for the new data retrieval logic.
6.  üî≤ Perform manual testing against Bitwig Studio, including scenarios with no track selected and no project parameters configured.

## Implementation Details

**Implementation Files Modified:**
- `BitwigApiFacade.java` - Added methods `getProjectParameters()` and `getSelectedTrackInfo()` with support for project parameters via MasterTrack and cursor track details
- `StatusTool.java` - Updated to include project parameters and selected track information in status response
- `docs/api-reference.md` - Updated to reflect new status response fields including project_parameters array and selected_track object
- `StatusToolTest.java` - Enhanced unit tests to cover new functionality with both populated and empty scenarios

**Implementation Notes:**
- Project parameters are accessed via `MasterTrack.createCursorRemoteControlsPage(8)` based on Bitwig's OSC API patterns
- Selected track information includes index, name, type, and all state flags (muted, soloed, armed, is_group)
- Only existing project parameters (where `exists()` is true) are returned in the response
- Selected track returns `null` if no track is currently selected
- All new fields are properly documented in the API reference with examples
- Code follows Java conventions and operational guidelines
- No new external dependencies were added
- StatusTool tests pass with comprehensive coverage of new functionality

**Testing & Verification:**
- Unit tests created in `StatusToolTest.java` with comprehensive coverage of new fields
- Tests cover both scenarios: with data present and with empty/null responses
- All StatusTool tests pass successfully
- Integration tests would be covered by broader MCP integration tests
- Manual testing pending (task 6)

**Documentation Updates:**
- `docs/api-reference.md` updated with detailed descriptions of new response fields
- Story file updated with implementation notes and completion status

**Summary:** The `StatusTool.java` has been updated to include project parameters and selected track information. The `BitwigApiFacade.java` provides new methods for accessing this data. The `api-reference.md` has been updated accordingly. Unit tests have been created and pass successfully. Manual testing is the only remaining task.

**Items Requiring User Attention:** Manual testing (task 6) needs to be performed before marking the story as complete.
