# Story 1.4: Implement MCP Transport Start Command

**Status:** Done

## Goal & Context

**User Story:** As a Musician (via an External AI Agent), I want to command WigAI to start Bitwig's playback via an MCP message, so that I can control transport hands-free.

**Context:** This story builds upon Story 1.3, which established the MCP server with standard MCP ping functionality and a custom status tool. Now we will implement the first Bitwig-interactive tool that actually controls the DAW. This transport control implementation will serve as a foundation for future interactive tools, demonstrating the pattern for tools that require Bitwig API interaction via the BitwigApiFacade.

## Detailed Requirements

* The WigAI MCP server (via the MCP Java SDK's tool system and the `TransportController` feature module) must implement a "transport_start" tool.
* This tool should follow the standard tool format defined in the MCP specification and follow the pattern established in Story 1.3.
* The tool implementation should:
  * Register a "transport_start" tool with the MCP server
  * Define an empty arguments schema (this tool takes no parameters)
  * When called, use the `BitwigApiFacade` to invoke the appropriate Bitwig API method to start the main transport playback (e.g., `host.transport().play()`)
  * Return a tool response following the MCP format:
    ```json
    {
      "jsonrpc": "2.0",
      "id": <id_from_request>,
      "result": {
        "content": [
          {
            "type": "text",
            "text": "Transport playback started."
          }
        ],
        "isError": false
      }
    }
    ```
* Log the command receipt, the action taken, and the response using the `Logger` service.

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

* AC1: Calling the "transport_start" MCP tool successfully starts Bitwig's main transport playback.
* AC2: WigAI returns a successful MCP response matching the specified JSON structure.
* AC3: If playback is already playing, the command is gracefully handled (Bitwig API typically handles this; WigAI should still return success).
* AC4: The `Logger` service logs the command, the invocation of the Bitwig play action, and the response.
* AC5: The tool is properly registered and appears in the response to a standard MCP `tools/list` request.

## Technical Implementation Context

**Guidance:** Use the following details for implementation. Developer agent is expected to follow project standards in `docs/coding-standards.md` and understand the project structure in `docs/project-structure.md`. Only story-specific details are included below.

- **Relevant Files:**

  - Files to Create:
    - `src/main/java/io/github/fabb/wigai/mcp/tool/TransportTool.java`: Implementation of the "transport_start" and (future) "transport_stop" tools using the MCP Java SDK's tool interfaces
    - `src/main/java/io/github/fabb/wigai/features/TransportController.java`: Controller class that bridges between MCP tools and Bitwig API operations for transport control

  - Files to Modify:
    - `src/main/java/io/github/fabb/wigai/mcp/McpServerManager.java`: Update to register the new TransportTool with the MCP server
    - `src/main/java/io/github/fabb/wigai/bitwig/BitwigApiFacade.java`: Ensure it has a method for transport start control (add if not already present)

- **Key Technologies:**

  - Java 21 (language features including records, interfaces, etc.)
  - MCP Java SDK (using the official tools-based implementation)
    - SDK's tool registry and request routing components
  - Bitwig Extension API v19
    - Transport API for playback control

- **API Interactions / SDK Usage:**

  - MCP Java SDK:
    - Tool registration, validation, and management
    - Tool response formatting
    
  - Bitwig API (via BitwigApiFacade):
    - `host.transport().play()` - To start transport playback

- **Data Structures:**

  - For the "transport_start" tool:
    - Tool Call Request:
      ```json
      {
        "jsonrpc": "2.0", 
        "id": 1, 
        "method": "tools/call", 
        "params": {
          "name": "transport_start", 
          "arguments": {}
        }
      }
      ```
    - Tool Call Response:
      ```json
      {
        "jsonrpc": "2.0",
        "id": 1,
        "result": {
          "content": [
            {
              "type": "text",
              "text": "Transport playback started."
            }
          ],
          "isError": false
        }
      }
      ```

- **Coding Standards Notes:**

  - Follow the established pattern from Story 1.3's "status" tool implementation
  - Implement tool interfaces according to MCP specification
  - Use Java records for tool input/output models where appropriate
  - Follow error handling strategy in `docs/coding-standards.md`
  - Log appropriate messages for incoming tool calls, Bitwig API interactions, and responses

## Testing Requirements

**Guidance:** Verify implementation against the ACs using the following tests. Follow general testing approach in `docs/testing-strategy.md`.

- **Unit Tests:** 
  - Create unit tests for `TransportTool` and `TransportController` with mocked `BitwigApiFacade`
  - Verify the tool properly invokes the facade's transport control method
  - Verify tool returns correct response format
  - Test error handling if applicable

- **Integration Tests:**
  - Test the integration between `TransportTool`, `TransportController`, and a mocked `BitwigApiFacade`

- **Manual/CLI Verification:**
  - Install the extension in Bitwig
  - Use curl or a similar HTTP client to call the "transport_start" tool
  - Verify that Bitwig's transport playback starts
  - Verify that the expected MCP response is received
  - Verify that calling the tool when transport is already playing is handled gracefully

## Story Wrap Up (Agent Populates After Execution)

- **Agent Model Used:** `GitHub Copilot`
- **Completion Notes:** I have implemented the transport_start tool for the MCP server as requested. The implementation follows the pattern established in Story 1.3 with the StatusTool. I created several new components:
  1. BitwigApiFacade - A facade for Bitwig API interactions, including transport control
  2. TransportController - A bridge between MCP tools and Bitwig API operations
  3. TransportTool - The MCP tool implementation for starting transport playback
  4. Unit tests for all new components
  
  I also updated the McpServerManager to create and register these components. The implementation has been successfully tested in a live Bitwig instance, confirming that the transport playback starts correctly when the tool is called and returns the expected response.

- **Change Log:**
  - Initial implementation of transport_start tool
  - Created BitwigApiFacade, TransportController, and TransportTool classes
  - Added unit tests for all new components
  - Updated McpServerManager to register the new tool
