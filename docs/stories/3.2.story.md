# Story 3.2: Trigger Scene by Index via MCP

**Status:** Done

## Story

- As a Musician (via an External AI Agent)
- I want to command WigAI to launch an entire scene in Bitwig by providing its numerical index through an MCP message
- so that I can trigger a collection of clips simultaneously

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

1. Sending the "launch_scene_by_index" MCP command with a valid `scene_index` launches the corresponding scene in Bitwig.
2. WigAI returns a successful MCP response matching the specified JSON structure.
3. If the `scene_index` is out of bounds (e.g., too high, or negative if not caught by parser), an MCP error response with code `SCENE_NOT_FOUND` is returned, and no scene is launched.
4. The `Logger` service logs the command, action, and relevant details.

## Tasks / Subtasks

  - [x] Add methods to support scene launching operations
  - [x] Handle scene index validation and bounds checking
  - [x] Location: `src/main/java/io/github/fabb/wigai/bitwig/BitwigApiFacade.java`

- [x] Run the build with `./gradlew build` - the build must pass

## Dev Technical Guidance

### Architecture Context
This story extends session control functionality, building on the established MCP tool pattern used in previous stories. It requires extending the `SceneController` for scene control logic and the `BitwigApiFacade` with scene launching capabilities.

### Key Technical Requirements

**MCP Tool Implementation:**
- Tool name: `launch_scene_by_index` (matches [`docs/api-reference.md#session_launchSceneByIndex`](docs/api-reference.md))
- Input schema: 
  ```java
  {
    "scene_index": Integer (non-negative, 0-based)
  }
  ```
- Response format: 
  ```java
  {
    "status": "success",
    "data": {
      "action": "scene_launched",
      "scene_index": 1,
      "message": "Scene 1 launched."
    }
  }
  ```
- Error handling: Return MCP tool result with `isError: true` for validation or operation errors

**Error Codes and Response Structure (from [`docs/api-reference.md`](docs/api-reference.md)):**
- `SCENE_NOT_FOUND`: When `scene_index` is out of bounds
- `BITWIG_ERROR`: For Bitwig API failures during launching

### Component Integration

**Clip/Scene Launch Module (per Architecture Component View):**
- Location: `src/main/java/io/github/fabb/wigai/features/ClipSceneController.java`
- Method: `launchSceneByIndex(int sceneIndex)` 
- Use dependency injection pattern for `BitwigApiFacade` access
- Implement proper validation and error handling
- Aligns with [`docs/component-view.md`](docs/component-view.md) Clip/Scene Launch Module specification

**BitwigApiFacade Extensions:**
- Add scene launching methods to support session control
- Implement scene index validation and bounds checking
- Location: `src/main/java/io/github/fabb/wigai/bitwig/BitwigApiFacade.java`
- Follow existing patterns from transport and device parameter implementations

**MCP Tool Implementation:**
- Extend existing `ClipTool` class in `src/main/java/io/github/fabb/wigai/mcp/tool/ClipTool.java` or create new tool class
- Follow same pattern as existing [`StatusTool`](src/main/java/io/github/fabb/wigai/mcp/tool/StatusTool.java), [`TransportTool`](src/main/java/io/github/fabb/wigai/mcp/tool/TransportTool.java), [`DeviceParamTool`](src/main/java/io/github/fabb/wigai/mcp/tool/DeviceParamTool.java)
- Use MCP Java SDK tool interfaces for schema validation and response handling
- Register in [`McpServerManager.java`](src/main/java/io/github/fabb/wigai/mcp/McpServerManager.java) following established pattern

### Error Handling Strategy (from [`docs/operational-guidelines.md`](docs/operational-guidelines.md))

**Input Validation:**
- Validate `scene_index` is a non-negative integer at MCP tool level
- Return appropriate MCP errors for validation failures

**Bitwig Integration Error Handling:**
- Handle scene index out of bounds conditions
- Use appropriate error codes for each type of failure

**Logging Requirements:**
- Use centralized [`Logger`](src/main/java/io/github/fabb/wigai/common/Logger.java) service
- Log command receipt with parameters
- Log scene launching operations and outcomes

### Testing Strategy

**Unit Tests:**
- Mock `BitwigApiFacade` for `SceneController` scene launching tests
- Test input validation for scene launching payloads
- Test error scenarios (scene index out of bounds)
- Test successful launching scenarios and response formatting

**Integration Tests:**
- Test MCP tool registration and scene launching workflow
- Test end-to-end scene launching with mocked Bitwig components

**Manual E2E Testing:**
- Create scenes in Bitwig Studio session view
- Send scene launching MCP commands with different indices
- Verify scenes launch correctly in Bitwig
- Test error conditions and verify appropriate error responses

### Project Structure Alignment

Following [`docs/project-structure.md`](docs/project-structure.md):
- Controller: `src/main/java/io/github/fabb/wigai/features/SceneController.java`
- Extended facade: `src/main/java/io/github/fabb/wigai/bitwig/BitwigApiFacade.java`
- Tool: `src/main/java/io/github/fabb/wigai/mcp/tool/`
- Test files mirror structure in `src/test/java/`

### Building on Existing Foundation

**Reuse Existing Patterns:**
- Follow MCP tool registration and error handling patterns from previous stories
- Use feature module pattern established by `TransportController` and `DeviceController`

**MCP Java SDK Integration:**
- Use `McpServerFeatures.SyncToolSpecification` for tool definition
- Follow input argument validation patterns from existing tools
