# Story 8.1: Implement `list_devices_on_track` Tool

**Epic:** [Epic 8: Device Information Retrieval](../epic-8.md)

**User Story:**

*   As an AI agent, I want to list all devices on a specific track (identified by name, index, or as the currently selected track), including their name, type, and key states (bypassed, expanded, window open, selected), so I can understand the signal chain of that track and identify the currently active device.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

*   An MCP tool named `list_devices_on_track` is implemented.
*   **Request Parameters:**
    *   `track_index` (integer, optional): 0-based index of the track.
    *   `track_name` (string, optional): Name of the track (case-sensitive, exact match).
    *   `get_selected` (boolean, optional): If `true`, lists devices for the currently selected track. Defaults to `true` when no parameter is provided.
    Rules:
    - Exactly one of `track_index`, `track_name`, or `get_selected` may be provided. If none provided, behaves as `get_selected=true`.
    - Providing multiple results in `INVALID_PARAMETER`.
*   **Response Body:** An array of device summary objects, each containing:
    *   `index` (integer): 0-based position in the track's device chain.
    *   `name` (string): Name of the device.
    *   `type` (string): One of "Instrument", "AudioFX", "NoteFX", or "Unknown".
    *   `bypassed` (boolean): True if the device is currently bypassed.
    *   `is_selected` (boolean): True if this device is the currently selected device in Bitwig Studio.
    Optional fields (API-dependent, may be omitted or null due to Bitwig Controller API limitations):
    *   `is_expanded` (boolean, optional)
    *   `is_window_open` (boolean, optional)
*   The tool correctly identifies the target track using the above rules; defaults to the `CursorTrack` when `get_selected=true` or when no identifiers are provided.
*   The tool iterates through the devices of the target track.
*   For each device, all supported fields (`index`, `name`, `type`, `bypassed`) are correctly retrieved from the Bitwig API. UI-state fields (`is_expanded`, `is_window_open`) are included only if available; otherwise they are omitted or set to null.
*   The `is_selected` field is determined by comparing against the global `CursorDevice`:
    - Prefer index-based comparison when a stable device index is available on the same track.
    - Otherwise, compare by device name on the selected track; if multiple matches exist, the first match is considered selected.
*   The tool handles tracks with no devices (returns an empty array).
*   The tool handles invalid identifiers with standardized error responses (`INVALID_PARAMETER`, `INVALID_RANGE`, `TRACK_NOT_FOUND`, `BITWIG_API_ERROR`).
*   Device enumeration is deterministic and complete:
    - Use a DeviceBank window size of 64 for the target trackâ€™s device chain.
    - Start from the first page, collect devices where slot.exists == true.
    - Page forward until no new devices are discovered (end reached). Order results by 0-based chain index.
*   Selection semantics are explicit:
    - If the target track is not the globally selected track, `is_selected` is `false` for all devices.
    - If the target track is the globally selected track, compare against the global CursorDevice:
      - Prefer same-track index match when a stable index is available.
      - Otherwise, compare by device name; if multiple matches, the first match is considered selected.
*   Device type mapping is defined:
    - Map Bitwig device types to: "Instrument", "AudioFX", "NoteFX", or "Unknown" (fallback).
*   Scope is limited to the top-level device chain of the target track (no recursion into container devices such as FX layers or nested chains).
*   Name matching uses exact, case-sensitive comparison (Java `String.equals` semantics); no locale folding or normalization applied.
*   UI-state fields policy:
    - `is_expanded` and `is_window_open` are included only if the Controller API exposes them; otherwise omit or use null. Do not change UI focus/selection to query these.
*   Error envelope format is standardized (must match MCP error handler output):
    - On error, respond with:
      ```json
      {
        "status": "error",
        "error": {
          "code": "TRACK_NOT_FOUND",
          "message": "No track is currently selected",
          "operation": "list_devices_on_track"
        }
      }
      ```
*   API documentation requirements:
    - `docs/api-reference.md` must include normative JSON examples covering:
      - Requests using each selector (`track_index`, `track_name`, `get_selected`/default).
      - Empty device list response.
      - Multi-device response with one selected device.
      - Sample error response using the standardized error envelope.
*   The `api-reference.md` is updated with the `list_devices_on_track` tool specification.
*   Unit tests are written for the `ListDevicesOnTrackTool.java` logic.
*   Manual testing confirms accuracy against various Bitwig project configurations.

**Tasks:**

1.  [x] Create `ListDevicesOnTrackTool.java` using the unified MCP tooling pattern (spec + handler) consistent with existing tools.
2.  [x] Implement parameter resolution enforcing the rules: exactly one of `track_index`, `track_name`, or `get_selected`; default to `get_selected=true` when none provided; `track_name` match is case-sensitive exact.
3.  [x] Resolve the target track via `TrackBank`/`CursorTrack`. Obtain its device list via `DeviceBank` (enumerate existing devices).
4.  [x] Iterate through devices and collect summaries.
5.  [x] For each `Device`, retrieve: index, `name()`, `deviceType()`, and `isEnabled()` (compute `bypassed = !isEnabled`). Do not attempt UI-state fields unless supported.
6.  [x] Determine `is_selected` by comparing with `CursorDevice`: prefer same-track index match; otherwise fallback to name match on the selected track (first match if ambiguous).
7.  [x] Construct the JSON response array as specified, omitting `is_expanded` and `is_window_open` or setting them to null if unavailable.
8.  [x] Add error handling using standardized codes (`INVALID_PARAMETER`, `INVALID_RANGE`, `TRACK_NOT_FOUND`, `BITWIG_API_ERROR`) and the unified MCP error handler.
9.  [x] Update `docs/api-reference.md` with the new tool specification.
10. [x] Write JUnit tests covering parameter validation, selected track, index/name resolution, empty-device chain, and error cases.
11. [x] Perform manual integration testing across audio/instrument/group tracks, with and without selected device.
