# Story 8.1: Implement `list_devices_on_track` Tool

**Epic:** [Epic 8: Device Information Retrieval](../epic-8.md)

**User Story:**

*   As an AI agent, I want to list all devices on a specific track (identified by name, index, or as the currently selected track), including their name, type, and key states (bypassed, expanded, window open, selected), so I can understand the signal chain of that track and identify the currently active device.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

*   An MCP tool named `list_devices_on_track` is implemented.
*   **Request Parameters:**
    *   `track_index` (integer, optional): 0-based index of the track.
    *   `track_name` (string, optional): Name of the track.
    *   `get_for_selected_track` (boolean, optional): If `true` (and no `track_index` or `track_name` is provided), lists devices for the currently selected track. Defaults to `true` if no track identifier is specified.
*   **Response Body:** An array of device summary objects, each containing:
    *   `index` (integer): 0-based position in the track's device chain.
    *   `name` (string): Name of the device.
    *   `type` (string): Type of the device (e.g., "Instrument", "AudioFX", "NoteFX").
    *   `is_bypassed` (boolean): True if the device is currently bypassed.
    *   `is_expanded` (boolean): True if the device GUI is expanded within the device chain view.
    *   `is_window_open` (boolean): True if the plugin window (if it has one) is currently open.
    *   `is_selected` (boolean): True if this device is the currently selected device in Bitwig Studio.
*   The tool correctly identifies the target track using `track_index`, `track_name`, or defaults to the `CursorTrack` if `get_for_selected_track` is true or no identifiers are provided.
*   The tool iterates through the `DeviceChain` of the target track.
*   For each device, all specified fields (`index`, `name`, `type`, `is_bypassed`, `is_expanded`, `is_window_open`) are correctly retrieved from the Bitwig API.
*   The `is_selected` field is correctly determined by comparing the device with the global `CursorDevice`.
*   The tool handles tracks with no devices (returns an empty array).
*   The tool handles invalid track identifiers by returning an appropriate error response.
*   The `api-reference.md` is updated with the `list_devices_on_track` tool specification.
*   Unit tests are written for the `ListDevicesOnTrackTool.java` logic.
*   Manual testing confirms accuracy against various Bitwig project configurations.

**Tasks:**

1.  Create `ListDevicesOnTrackTool.java` implementing the `MCPTool` interface.
2.  Implement logic to resolve the target `Track` object based on request parameters (index, name, or selected).
3.  If track is found, access its `DeviceChain` (e.g., `track.getDeviceChain()`).
4.  Iterate through the devices in the chain.
5.  For each `Device` object, retrieve its `indexInDeviceChain()`, `name()`, `deviceType()`, `isBypassed()`, `isExpanded()`, `isWindowOpen()`.
6.  To determine `is_selected`, get the global `CursorDevice` and compare its `equals()` method or a unique ID if available.
7.  Construct the JSON response array as specified.
8.  Add error handling for track not found or API issues.
9.  Update `docs/api-reference.md`.
10. Write JUnit tests.
11. Perform manual integration testing.
