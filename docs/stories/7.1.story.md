# Story 7.1: Implement `list_scenes` Tool

**Epic:** [Epic 7: Scene and Clip Information Retrieval](../epic-7.md)

**User Story:**

*   As an AI agent, I want to list all scenes in the current project with their name, color, and selection status, so I can understand the song's structure and identify the currently cued scene.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

*   An MCP tool named `list_scenes` is implemented.
*   **Request Parameters:** (None)
*   **Response Body:** An array of scene objects, each containing:
    *   `index` (integer): 0-based index of the scene.
    *   `name` (string): Name of the scene.
    *   `color` (string, nullable): Color of the scene (e.g., "rgb(r,g,b)").
    *   `is_selected` (boolean): True if this scene is currently selected/cued in the launcher (global scene selection).
*   The `list_scenes` tool correctly queries the Bitwig API (e.g., `SceneBank`) to retrieve all scenes and their specified information.
*   The tool correctly identifies the `is_selected` scene based on Bitwig's global scene cursor/selection.
*   The tool functions correctly in an empty project (returns an empty array).
*   The `api-reference.md` is updated with the `list_scenes` tool specification.
*   Unit tests are written for the `ListScenesTool.java` logic.
*   Manual testing confirms accuracy against various Bitwig project configurations.

**Tasks:**

1.  Create `ListScenesTool.java` implementing the `MCPTool` interface.
2.  Implement logic to access Bitwig's `SceneBank` (or equivalent) to get all scenes.
3.  For each scene, extract `index`, `name`, `color`, and `is_selected` status.
4.  Construct the JSON response as specified.
5.  Add error handling for API interactions.
6.  Update `docs/api-reference.md` with the `list_scenes` tool details.
7.  Write JUnit tests for `ListScenesTool.java`.
8.  Perform manual integration testing with a Bitwig project.
