# Story 6.1: Implement `list_tracks` Tool

**Status:** Review

**Epic:** [Epic 6: Track Information Retrieval](../epic-6.md)

**User Story:**

*   As an AI agent, I want to list all tracks in the current project with summary information (name, type, selection state, parent group, basic device list), so I can understand the overall project structure and identify the user's current focus.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

*   An MCP tool named `list_tracks` is implemented.
*   **Request Parameters:**
    *   `type` (string, optional): Filter by track type (e.g., "audio", "instrument", "group", "effect", "master").
*   **Response Body:** An array of track objects, each containing:
    *   `index` (integer): 0-based position in the project's main track list.
    *   `name` (string): Name of the track.
    *   `type` (string): Type of the track (e.g., "audio", "instrument", "hybrid", "group", "effect", "master").
    *   `is_group` (boolean): True if the track is a group track.
    *   `parent_group_index` (integer, nullable): 0-based index of the parent group track if this track is inside a group, `null` otherwise.
    *   `activated` (boolean): Is the track activated.
    *   `color` (string): Color of the track (e.g., "rgb(r,g,b)").
    *   `is_selected` (boolean): True if this is the currently selected track.
    *   `devices` (array of objects): Summary of devices on this track.
        *   `index` (integer): 0-based position in this track's device chain.
        *   `name` (string): Name of the device.
        *   `type` (string): Type of the device (e.g. "Instrument", "AudioFX", "NoteFX").
*   The `list_tracks` tool correctly queries the Bitwig API (e.g., `TrackBank`) to retrieve all tracks and their specified summary information.
*   The tool correctly identifies and flags the `is_selected` track.
*   The tool correctly lists summary device information for each track by iterating its `DeviceChain`.
*   The tool handles optional `type` filtering correctly.
*   The tool functions correctly in an empty project (returns an empty array).
*   The `api-reference.md` is updated with the `list_tracks` tool specification.
*   Unit tests are written for the `ListTracksTool.java` logic.
*   Manual testing confirms accuracy against various Bitwig project configurations.

**Tasks:**

1.  ✅ Create `ListTracksTool.java` implementing the `MCPTool` interface.
2.  ✅ Implement logic to access Bitwig's `TrackBank` to get all tracks.
3.  ✅ For each track, extract `index`, `name`, `type`, `is_group`, `parent_group_index`, `activated`, `color`, and `is_selected` status.
4.  ✅ For each track, iterate its `DeviceChain` to build the `devices` summary array (`index`, `name`, `type`).
5.  ✅ Implement optional filtering based on the `type` request parameter.
6.  ✅ Construct the JSON response as specified.
7.  ✅ Add error handling for API interactions.
8.  ✅ Update `docs/api-reference.md` with the `list_tracks` tool details.
9.  ✅ Write JUnit tests for `ListTracksTool.java`.
10. ⏳ Perform manual integration testing with a Bitwig project.

**Implementation Notes:**

- **BitwigApiFacade Enhancement**: Added `getAllTracksInfo(String typeFilter)` method to retrieve track information with optional type filtering
- **Track Properties**: Implemented extraction of index, name, type, is_group, color, is_selected, activated status, and parent_group_index detection using Bitwig API methods
- **Device Information**: Implemented device enumeration for each track using Track's DeviceChain interface
- **Type Filtering**: Added validation and filtering for track types: audio, instrument, group, effect, master, hybrid
- **Error Handling**: Uses unified error handling architecture with McpErrorHandler
- **API Documentation**: Updated `docs/api-reference.md` with complete `list_tracks` tool specification
- **Testing**: Created comprehensive unit tests for ListTracksTool with parameter validation
- **Registration**: Added tool to McpServerManager for availability via MCP API
- **Response Format Fix**: Corrected MCP response to return tracks array directly instead of wrapped in additional metadata

**Development Model**: Claude Sonnet 4 via Copilot Chat

**Known Limitations:**
- Device type classification is basic pattern matching - could be enhanced with more sophisticated device categorization
