# Story 6.2: Implement `get_track_details` Tool

**Epic:** [Epic 6: Track Information Retrieval](../epic-6.md)

**User Story:**

*   As an AI agent, I want to get detailed information for a specific track (by index, name, or by targeting the currently selected track, defaulting to selected if no specifier), including its parameters (volume, pan, mute, solo, arm), sends, and a list of its clips with their properties (name, color, length, loop status), so I can perform targeted analysis or suggest modifications.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

*   An MCP tool named `get_track_details` is implemented.
*   **Request Parameters:**
    *   `track_index` (integer, optional): 0-based index of the track.
    *   `track_name` (string, optional): Name of the track.
    *   `get_selected` (boolean, optional): If true, retrieves details for the currently selected track. If no parameters (`track_index`, `track_name`, `get_selected`) are provided, this defaults to `true`.
*   **Response Body:** A single track object containing:
    *   All fields from the `list_tracks` response object for this track (i.e., `index`, `name`, `type`, `is_group`, `parent_group_index`, `activated`, `color`, `is_selected`, and the `devices` array with device summaries).
    *   `volume` (float): Normalized volume (0.0-1.0).
    *   `volume_str` (string): Formatted volume string (e.g., "-6.0 dB").
    *   `pan` (float): Normalized pan.
    *   `pan_str` (string): Formatted pan string.
    *   `muted` (boolean): Is the track muted.
    *   `soloed` (boolean): Is the track soloed.
    *   `armed` (boolean): Is the track armed for recording.
    *   `monitor_enabled` (boolean): Is monitoring enabled.
    *   `auto_monitor_enabled` (boolean): Is auto-monitoring enabled.
    *   `sends` (array of objects): List of sends for the track.
        *   `name` (string): Name of the send channel.
        *   `volume` (float): Normalized send level.
        *   `volume_str` (string): Formatted send level string.
        *   `activated` (boolean): Is the send activated.
    *   `clips` (array of objects): List of clips in the track's slots.
        *   `slot_index` (integer): 0-based index of the clip slot.
        *   `scene_name` (string, nullable): Name of the scene this slot aligns with.
        *   `has_content` (boolean): True if the slot contains a clip.
        *   `clip_name` (string, nullable): Name of the clip.
        *   `clip_color` (string, nullable): Color of the clip.
        *   `length` (string, nullable): Length of the clip (e.g., "4.0.0").
        *   `is_looping` (boolean, nullable): True if the clip is set to loop.
*   The `get_track_details` tool correctly identifies the target track based on `track_index`, `track_name`, or `get_selected` (or defaults to selected).
*   The tool retrieves all specified detailed information using the Bitwig API (e.g., `CursorTrack` or specific `Track` object properties, `ClipLauncherSlotBank`).
*   The tool correctly formats clip `length` and `is_looping` status.
*   The tool handles cases where a track is not found (for by index/name) or no track is selected (if `get_selected` is true or defaulted) by returning an appropriate error response.
*   The `api-reference.md` is updated with the `get_track_details` tool specification.
*   Unit tests are written for the `GetTrackDetailsTool.java` logic.
*   Manual testing confirms accuracy against various Bitwig project configurations and track states.

**Tasks:**

1.  Create `GetTrackDetailsTool.java` implementing the `MCPTool` interface.
2.  Implement logic to identify the target track:
    *   If `track_index` is provided, get track by index.
    *   If `track_name` is provided, find track by name.
    *   If `get_selected` is true, or if no parameters are provided, use `CursorTrack`.
3.  Once the target track is identified, retrieve all basic information as per `list_tracks` (or reuse logic).
4.  Retrieve detailed properties: `volume`, `pan`, `muted`, `soloed`, `armed`, `monitor_enabled`, `auto_monitor_enabled`.
5.  Retrieve send information.
6.  Access the track's `ClipLauncherSlotBank` to retrieve details for each clip slot: `slot_index`, `scene_name`, `has_content`, `clip_name`, `clip_color`, `length`, `is_looping`.
7.  Construct the JSON response as specified.
8.  Implement robust error handling (e.g., track not found, no track selected).
9.  Update `docs/api-reference.md` with the `get_track_details` tool details.
10. Write JUnit tests for `GetTrackDetailsTool.java`.
11. Perform manual integration testing.
