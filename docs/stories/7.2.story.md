# Story 7.2: Implement `get_clips_in_scene` Tool

**Epic:** [Epic 7: Scene and Clip Information Retrieval](../epic-7.md)

**User Story:**

*   As an AI agent, I want to get detailed information for all clips within a specific scene (by index or name), including their track context, content properties (name, color, length, loop status), and playback states, so I can analyze or prepare a scene for launching.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

*   An MCP tool named `get_clips_in_scene` is implemented.
*   **Request Parameters:**
    *   `scene_index` (integer, optional): 0-based index of the scene.
    *   `scene_name` (string, optional): Name of the scene.
    *   *(At least one of `scene_index` or `scene_name` must be provided)*
*   **Response Body:** An array of clip slot objects for the specified scene. Each object contains:
    *   `track_index` (integer): 0-based index of the track this slot belongs to.
    *   `track_name` (string): Name of the track this slot belongs to.
    *   `has_content` (boolean): True if a clip exists in this slot.
    *   `clip_name` (string, nullable): Name of the clip if `has_content` is true.
    *   `clip_color` (string, nullable): Color of the clip if `has_content` is true.
    *   `length` (string, nullable): Length of the clip (e.g., "4.0.0") if `has_content` is true.
    *   `is_looping` (boolean, nullable): True if the clip is set to loop, if `has_content` is true.
    *   `is_playing` (boolean): True if the clip in this slot is currently playing.
    *   `is_recording` (boolean): True if the clip in this slot is currently recording.
    *   `is_playback_queued` (boolean): True if playback is queued for the clip in this slot.
    *   `is_recording_queued` (boolean): True if recording is queued for the clip in this slot.
    *   `is_stop_queued` (boolean): True if a stop is queued for the clip in this slot.
*   The `get_clips_in_scene` tool correctly identifies the target scene based on `scene_index` or `scene_name`.
*   The tool iterates through all tracks (`TrackBank`) and for each track, accesses its `ClipLauncherSlotBank` at the specified scene's index to retrieve clip details.
*   The tool correctly populates all specified fields for each clip slot object.
*   The tool handles cases where a scene is not found by returning an appropriate error response.
*   The tool correctly handles tracks that do not have a clip in the specified scene (e.g., by not including them or by representing an empty slot appropriately if all tracks are always listed).
*   The `api-reference.md` is updated with the `get_clips_in_scene` tool specification.
*   Unit tests are written for the `GetClipsInSceneTool.java` logic.
*   Manual testing confirms accuracy against various Bitwig project configurations.

**Tasks:**

1.  Create `GetClipsInSceneTool.java` implementing the `MCPTool` interface.
2.  Implement logic to identify the target scene by `scene_index` or `scene_name`.
3.  If scene is found, iterate through all tracks in the project (`TrackBank`).
4.  For each track, get the `ClipLauncherSlot` at the target scene's index.
5.  From the slot, extract all required clip information: `track_index`, `track_name`, `has_content`, `clip_name`, `clip_color`, `length`, `is_looping`, and all playback/queue states.
6.  Construct the JSON response array as specified.
7.  Implement robust error handling (e.g., scene not found).
8.  Update `docs/api-reference.md` with the `get_clips_in_scene` tool details.
9.  Write JUnit tests for `GetClipsInSceneTool.java`.
10. Perform manual integration testing.
